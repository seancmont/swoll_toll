	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Sean. I'm from Lexington, KY and I started my career as a web developer in 2017. In my free time from work/study I like to play sports and lift weights. However, I recently noticed that I could be more efficient with my lifts if I kept closer track of the exercises I did each day. I've always got my phone on me at the gym for the essential jam sessions, so a program on my phone that would track my lifts seemed like a perfect solution. Thus, The Swoll Toll was born. Enjoy. </p>
